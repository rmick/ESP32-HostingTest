# ESP32-HostingTest
This is a Work In Progress !!!!
When finished it will be a simple stand-alone Ltto Lazertag Host code to suit the Combobulator hardware. Easily adapted to run on any ESP32 based hardware. Requires https://github.com/rmick/esp32_IR_Ltto for operation.    Any questions to rmick@msn.com.au
